With 'Open via UCSF' you can right click on any link to open it via the UCSF VPN Web Proxy. You can also reopen the current page via the Web Proxy by clicking on the icon in the address bar.  This is useful when for instance accessing journal articles when outside of the UCSF computer network.

When installed, the extensions adds (i) an 'Open in new tab via UCSF VPN Web Proxy' entry to the context ("right-click") menu, and (ii) a 'Reopen current page via UCSF VPN Web Proxy' icon to the address bar. The first time you open a link via UCSF, you will be asked to authenticate yourself using your UCSF credentials. All following links will be opened directly, until you restart the browser.

REQUIREMENTS:
This extension will only be useful to users that have an account at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF).
